## Goals

Everybody who writes a research article knows that typesetting the bibtex file is always a tedious task üò©. We are never 
100% sure if all the fields are complete, or if any of them is missed ü§î. 

Unfortunately, I cannot help you with all your bibliography items üò¢. However, I can do in such papers at which I am one
 of the authors. Therefore, the aim of this repository is to give you a full list of all the research items (working 
 projects, published papers, etc) I appear as author, written in bib style. In this way, you only have to copy the item 
 you are interested in, and add to your own bib file. 
 
 Any feedback is welcome, üòÑ so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy üò≥ and do not want to
write in the repo, I will be happy to answer you by email at asuncionjc@uma.es üë©üèª‚Äçüíª .
